            Like the tender cool breeze which brushes past, oft unnoticed, <br>
            Yet does not fail to touch everyone and everything. <br>
            Like the chirping of birds unknown, <br>
            Which merge into the hustle bustle of the city. <br>
            Like the subtle fragrance of a distant flower, <br>
            Which fills the air only to be lost. <br>
            You have been a constant presence. <br>
            Like the sun’s embrace, <br>
            At times comforting, at times scorching with its grace. <br>
            Dear Ma, I am weird. (So are you) <br>
            I can’t live with you, nor can I live without you. <br>
            A very Happy Birthday, I wish you. :)<br>-->bhapp!</p>
